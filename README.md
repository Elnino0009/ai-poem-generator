## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the poem generator on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (version 18 or higher)
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **[OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)** (you'll need to create an account)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd poem-generator-app
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     cp env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit the `.env` file and replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
     ```

6. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend

1. **Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 4: Use the Application

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click the "Generate Poem ✨" button
3. Enjoy your AI-generated poem!

## 🔐 Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Important Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.env` file should contain your actual API key and remain private.

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### Backend API (`http://localhost:8000`)

- **GET /** - Health check endpoint
- **POST /generate-poem** - Generate a poem
  ```json
  {
    "topic": "nature"
  }
  ```

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing the Poem Topic
You can modify the poem topic by editing the `topic` field in the API request in `frontend/app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({ topic: 'your-custom-topic' })
```

### Styling Changes
The UI uses Tailwind CSS. You can customize colors, spacing, and layout by modifying the classes in the React components.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend Deployment
- Consider using **[Railway](https://railway.app/)**, **[Heroku](https://heroku.com/)**, or **[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)**
- Make sure to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your hosting platform

### Frontend Deployment
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** (recommended for Next.js)
- **[Netlify](https://netlify.com/)**
- Update the API URL in your frontend to point to your deployed backend

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is required"**
   - Make sure you've created a `.env` file in the backend directory
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is correctly set

2. **"Failed to generate poem"**
   - Check your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Verify the backend server is running on port 8000

3. **"Could not connect to the poem generator"**
   - Ensure both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000) are running
   - Check for any firewall or network issues

4. **Module not found errors**
   - Make sure you've installed all dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt` for backend, `npm install` for frontend)
   - Verify you're in the correct virtual environment for Python

## 🌟 What's Next?

Some ideas for you to extend this project:
- Add more poem topics and styles
- Implement user authentication
- Save favorite poems to a database
- Add social sharing features
- Create different poem formats (haiku, sonnet, etc.)
